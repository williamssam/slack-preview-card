## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Tailwind CSS

### What I learned

- Installing tailwindcss and other dependencies like postcss and autoprefixer
- Using utility first workflow with tailwindcss
- Adding my custom style with '@apply' in tailwind
- Extending tailwind with my own font-family, color codes, background-image, height and screen size.

### Continued development

Will be building more complex designs using Tailwind CSS in the future and also work on my responsiveness and positioning.

### Useful resources

- [Tailwind CSS docs](https://tailwindcss.com/docs) - This helped me on adding custom style and extending tailwind functionalitie.
